## Why is there a need?

19 seconds is the average time a mobile web page takes to load on a 3G connection. This causes the page's bounce rate to increase exponentially. Conversion probability drops by more than 60% if they didn't wait for those seconds as people are used to working with apps that are instant. 

To solve this, we embark on this mission to make every page we develop, load in <2 seconds with progressive enhancements, with no compromise in accessibility, reliability or appearance. 

## The Mission

All pages load in less than 2 seconds on all devices consistently

This Project uses HTML5, CSS3 and Vannila JS and some WebP Images and SVGs. Hosted on Cloudflare Pages

PS: This page loads fully with a speed index of **0.4** seconds and takes **0.3** seconds to interact.
